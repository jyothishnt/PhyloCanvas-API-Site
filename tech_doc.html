                  <h3>Code Structure</h3>
                  <p>The PhyloCanvas code is Object-oriented and uses the prototype
                    of a JavaScript "class" to describe the class functions.<p>

                  <p>As well as providing an organisational structure for the code, using
                  the prototype means that the code for the functions isn't copied into memory
                  for each instance of PhyloCanvas.</p>

                  <h3>Rendering</h3>
                  <p>The rendering engine for PhyloCanvas is designed
                    to minimise the amount of load that is placed on the client browser.
                    As such the rendering events only fire when the user performs an action
                    such as zooming or panning through the tree.
                  </p>
                  <p>The rendering itself is split into 2 phases, a pre-render to
                    perform all the calculations related to determining the postion
                    and layout of the tree, leaving only the actual drawing of the tree
                    at the correct positon (offset) and zoom level. </p>
                  <p>When a subtree of the main tree is redrawn from a branch or
                  a branch is rotated the tree reset and then pre-render must be re-run.</p>
